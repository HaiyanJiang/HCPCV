Description: Determining the number of change-points via high-dimensional 
    cross-valadition. 
    Two change-point detection algorithms are used to find the locations of 
    estimated change-points, i.e., dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, 
    optimal partitioning  (OP) approach, and the pruned exact linear time (PELT)
    method.
